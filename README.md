Article: [From Punch Cards to Python: A Journey Through Computing](https://spectrum.ieee.org/from-punch-cards-to-python)

I found this article interesting because it highlights the contributions of historical computer scientists and mathematicians and ultimately how
critical those contributions were to software development. Grace Hopper's development of the compiler made programming and the understanding of 
code much easier by enabling the use of higher level languages. It is fascinating to see how historical developments made programming less 
cumbersome and how current advancements such as AI-assisted programming and low-code development continue to increase accessibility.

Tahsin Tawhid: I found [this article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/from-punch-cards-to-python) a simple, yet comprehensive way of showcasing an important contribution to software development and its ripple effects to our future. Many think of the Internet or relatively new PCs being the start of software development or important technology, but a lot of what these things are built on start from things such as compilers or punch cards from almost 70 years ago. It's also very interesting that Hopper was able to create a library so that the machine can decipher English text, which is very much important to everything we do now while programming.
