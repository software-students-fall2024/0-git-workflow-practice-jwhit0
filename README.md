Article: [From Punch Cards to Python: A Journey Through Computing](https://spectrum.ieee.org/from-punch-cards-to-python)

I found this article interesting because it highlights the contributions of historical computer scientists and mathematicians and ultimately how
critical those contributions were to software development. Grace Hopper's development of the compiler made programming and the understanding of 
code much easier by enabling the use of higher level languages. It is fascinating to see how historical developments made programming less 
cumbersome and how current advancements such as AI-assisted programming and low-code development continue to increase accessibility.
